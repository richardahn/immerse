1
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:12,063

2
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,921
<i>Once in a while when I wake up</i>

3
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,755
<i>I find myself crying.</i>

4
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:05,422
<i>The dream I must have had
I can never recall.</i>

5
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:06,922
<i>But...</i>

6
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,423
<i>But...</i>

7
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:11,756
<i>the sensation that I've lost something</i>

8
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:15,548
<i>lingers for a long time after I wake up.</i>

9
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:25,424
<i>I'm always searching</i>

10
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:27,924
<i>for something, for someone.</i>

11
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:33,299
<i>This feeling has possessed me
I think from that day...</i>

12
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,717
<i>That day when the stars came falling.</i>

13
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,675
<i>It was almost as if...</i>

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,675
<i>as if a scene from a dream.</i>

15
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,925
<i>Nothing more, nothing less</i>

16
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:48,426
<i>than a beautiful view.</i>

17
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,925
<i>Ah, if only our voices speak at night</i>

18
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:59,426
<i>could ever reach the very edge of this world,
and the time</i>

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,301
<i>Instead of fading into air and dust</i>

20
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,260
<i>Then what will the words could ever be?
farthest words from 'probably'</i>

21
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:16,635
<i>Let's make a promise, that will never fade
Let's say it together in count of three, oh</i>

22
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:30,554
<i>Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish
will be heard</i>

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,470
<i>But lately I lost sight of the truth in those words</i>

24
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,303
<i>I can't even remember when I gave up believing
What could have been the reason?</i>

25
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:43,971
<i>Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop
And the place rainbow born and dies</i>

26
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,138
<i>And where the end of this life lies</i>

27
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:50,304
<i>I've always been insisting
there was something that I've longing for</i>

28
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:59,597
<i>One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented</i>

29
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:04,264
<i>We'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time</i>

30
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,973
<i>The five dimensions keep on teasing me
But I will keep on looking at you, dear</i>

31
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:13,973
<i>Let's make a sign for when we say
"nice to meet you" again</i>

32
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,224
<i>I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name</i>

33
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,767
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

34
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,059
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

35
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,309
My name is...

36
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:58,727
Mitsuha!

37
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:37,187
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

38
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,730
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

39
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,688
What? "Mitsuha"?

40
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,397
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

41
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:48,564
Hurry up!

42
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,898
What? What?

43
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,150
Do you want last night's leftovers?

44
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:23,691
You can have it.

45
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,858
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:27,525
Mitsuha, you're late!

47
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,817
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

48
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:36,734
Is this too much?

49
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,401
Oh well.

50
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,317
You're normal today.

51
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,735
You were nuts yesterday.

52
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,985
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,735
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

54
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,402
<i>This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.</i>

55
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,402
<i>Regarding the mayoral election</i>

56
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:03,069
<i>to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...</i>

57
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:12,029
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

58
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,653
<i>The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...</i>

59
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:18,653
Just make it up with him.

60
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,029
It's an adult matter.

61
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:23,404
<i>"Position of Comet Tiamat"...JAXA are preparing
to observe the celestial show of the century.</i>

62
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:24,529
<i>...JAXA are preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.</i>

63
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,739
We're going now!

64
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,032
Study hard!

65
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:11,615
Mitsuha!

66
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,616
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

67
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,658
Morning.

68
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,616
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

69
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,408
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

70
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,700
You two get along so well.

71
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,159
We do not!

72
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:28,117
Your hair looks all right today.

73
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:29,284
What?

74
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,117
- Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

75
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:34,993
You were totally possessed!

76
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:40,493
Cut out the occultism.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

77
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,326
Huh? What are you talking about?

78
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,618
You don't remember?

79
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:47,618
And above all,

80
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,286
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

81
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:55,578
Only when these are achieved

82
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:59,119
can a safe and secure community
be created!

83
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:01,703
As the incumbent mayor...

84
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,536
He'll be reelected again anyway.

85
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,120
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

86
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,203
Hey, Miyamizu.

87
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:10,454
Morning.

88
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:14,412
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along too.

89
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,620
Ew.

90
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,371
Mitsuha!

91
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,246
Stand up straight!

92
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,122
- He's strict with his family.
- I'm impressed.

93
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,621
- So embarrassing.
- Sucks to be her.

94
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,122
Mitsuha.

95
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:36,039
In front of everybody...

96
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,622
"Who are you?"

97
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:50,423
"Tasokare"

98
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:55,582
"Tasokare" means "Who is that" and is
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

99
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:59,416
Twilight, when it's
neither day nor night.

100
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:05,124
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

101
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,499
Older expressions include
"karetaso-doki"

102
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:15,625
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

103
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:19,667
Kataware-doki? I think
that's a local dialect.

104
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:23,500
I've heard that Itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

105
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,625
"Who are you?"

106
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:30,084
Okay next, Mitsuha.

107
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,585
Yes.

108
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:35,626
Oh, so you remember your name today.

109
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,626
You don't remember?

110
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:45,836
Yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were.

111
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,794
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

112
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,919
What? No way! Really?

113
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:56,336
It was like you had amnesia.

114
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,795
Well, I do feel like
I've been in a strange dream lately...

115
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:04,295
A dream about someone else's life?

116
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,503
I can't remember clearly.

117
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:10,087
I know! That was...

118
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:11,421
your previous life!

119
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:15,546
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

120
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,838
Stay out of this.

121
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:20,504
Oh! Tessie, did you write that
in my notebook?

122
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,589
Nothing.

123
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:28,297
But Mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

124
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:30,547
You been feeling alright?

125
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,756
That's so strange. I feel fine.

126
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:38,715
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

127
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,423
Oh, don't remind me!

128
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,798
I can't stand this town anymore.

129
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:50,090
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

130
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:55,090
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

131
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:58,758
Trains come every 2 hours.

132
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,799
The store closes at 9 p.m.

133
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,758
No bookstore. No dentist.

134
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:05,300
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"
But 2 pubs for some reason.

135
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:06,425
No jobs.

136
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:07,550
No brides.

137
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:09,550
Short sunlight hours.

138
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,092
- Give me a break!
- What?

139
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,717
I mean... How about we stop by a café?

140
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,051
- A café?
- Really?

141
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,551
Where?

142
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,926
Hello.

143
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,760
Hello.

144
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:33,926
This is a café?

145
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,053
You knew there wasn't one.

146
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,719
Mitsuha just went home.

147
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:42,303
Things must be rough for her.

148
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:44,761
Well, she takes center stage.

149
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,261
Yeah.

150
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,595
Hey, Tessie.

151
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,386
What?

152
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,220
What will you do after you graduate?

153
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:58,095
What's this?
You asking about my future?

154
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:05,387
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

155
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,056
I'd rather do that too.

156
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,805
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

157
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,264
Listen to the thread's voice.

158
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:31,598
When you keep twining like that,

159
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:35,931
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

160
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,557
Threads don't talk.

161
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,848
She means, "Concentrate."

162
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:45,640
1,000 years of Itomori's history is etched
into our braided cords.

163
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,557
Listen. 200 years ago...

164
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,308
Here she goes again.

165
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:58,059
Sandal maker Mayugoro's bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

166
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:01,516
The shrine and old documents
were destroyed

167
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,225
and this is known as...

168
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,267
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

169
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,225
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

170
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:15,893
So the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on.

171
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:20,851
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

172
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:25,351
That's the important task
we at Miyamizu Shrine have.

173
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,061
But that foolish son-in-law...

174
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:37,269
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and
this house weren't enough,

175
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:40,269
now politics? He's hopeless.

176
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,728
Have another, my man.

177
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,145
I'm counting on your help again.

178
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,479
Leave it to me.

179
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,353
You'll get votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts.

180
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,771
How's it going with her?

181
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,937
It's not that easy.

182
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,646
I smell corruption.

183
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,480
Don't be ridiculous.

184
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,146
Bring us a few more hot <i>sake.</i>

185
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,438
Okay.

186
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:09,105
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

187
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,355
Learn how to use explosives.

188
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:13,481
Can't hear you.

189
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,481
Yes!

190
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,106
We both have it rough, don't we?

191
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,233
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

192
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,983
They're both pretty like their mother.

193
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:57,734
Hey.

194
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:58,942
Hey.

195
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,736
It's the oldest <i>sake</i> in the world.

196
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:39,695
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

197
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,737
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate
<i>sake</i> made that way?

198
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,613
Of course they do.

199
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,945
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

200
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,863
Oh! I could never do that!

201
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,655
Isn't she embarrassed?

202
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,530
I can't believe it.

203
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,823
Cheer up, Mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

204
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,032
I envy your pre-pubescent
lack of concern.

205
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:29,907
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and
use the money to go to Tokyo?

206
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,532
Where do you get such ideas?

207
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:37,908
Sell them with photos and making videos.
Name it "Shrine Maiden's <i>Sake</i>."

208
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,783
You'll make money!

209
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,866
"Shrine Maiden's <i>Sake</i>"

210
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:45,617
No. That breaks the Liquor Tax Law.

211
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:48,909
That's the problem?

212
00:16:55,284 --> 00:17:00,159
I hate this town! I hate this life!

213
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:04,576
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

214
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:10,744
What a fool...

215
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,579
Ow!

216
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,412
Ouch...

217
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,288
Where...

218
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:07,581
Something's there...

219
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,457
Ow!

220
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,624
Taki! Are you up?

221
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:30,124
It was your turn to cook.
Wake up on time.

222
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:31,458
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:36,291
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

224
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,458
Okay.

225
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:41,417
Go to school even if you're late.
See you.

226
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,292
Have a nice day.

227
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:56,668
What a strange dream.

228
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:01,293
"From Tsukasa:
Run, you're late!"

229
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:06,294
What? Who's it from?
Tsukasa? Who's that?

230
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:17,961
I have to use the bathroom.

231
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,670
This is too realistic.

232
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,965
"Shinjuku Station"

233
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,842
I'm in Tokyo.

234
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,468
"Jingu High School"

235
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,468
- Where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

236
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,468
The front act at the next gig...

237
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,469
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

238
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,469
Taki!

239
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:06,261
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

240
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:08,928
You ignored my text.

241
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,803
Oh, Tsukasa?

242
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:13,720
At least you sound apologetic.

243
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,720
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

244
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,470
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

245
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:25,137
- Uh... Well... I...
- Feminine?

246
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:26,679
I!

247
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:28,387
I?

248
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,721
I?

249
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:37,638
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

250
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:40,222
You seem to have a dialect.

251
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,472
Where's your lunch?

252
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,597
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

253
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,806
- You got something?
- Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

254
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:54,556
Thank you.

255
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,807
Let's go to a café.

256
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:00,473
Oh that one? Okay. Coming, Taki?

257
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,265
What? What? What?

258
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,057
A café?

259
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,140
Nice timberwork up there.

260
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:12,432
Yeah, attention to detail.

261
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:14,100
Taki, have you decided?

262
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,558
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

263
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:22,391
What age are you from again?

264
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:26,308
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

265
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,643
What a great dream.

266
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,060
Oh no, what should I do?
I'm late for work!

267
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,477
Your shift is today?

268
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:47,644
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

269
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,060
Oh! Um...

270
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:54,977
Where do I work?

271
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:56,560
What?

272
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,895
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

273
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,104
Table 12! Taki!

274
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:09,561
Here you go.

275
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:12,562
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

276
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,062
We didn't order that.

277
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:16,562
Taki, I said no more truffles!

278
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,562
Taki, can't hear you!

279
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:19,562
Taki!

280
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,562
When is this dream going to end?

281
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:34,271
Hey. Hey waiter.

282
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:35,563
Oh, yes?

283
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,481
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

284
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:44,064
We could have gotten hurt.

285
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,648
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

286
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:50,815
Uh, well...

287
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:55,649
But... There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

288
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,732
Excuse me.

289
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:01,024
Is everything okay?

290
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,066
I'll handle this.

291
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,732
What's wrong with you today?

292
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:11,316
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

293
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:12,441
Oh, really?

294
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:14,691
I hope you weren't hurt.

295
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:25,984
Um...

296
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,484
Okudera...

297
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,526
Ms. Okudera.

298
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:31,609
Ms. Okudera. Thank you...

299
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,151
A stroke of bad luck today.

300
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:34,276
No, uh...

301
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,819
Bet it was a set-up.

302
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:39,443
Handled it according to the manual, but...

303
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,985
Oh, Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

304
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:45,319
You okay?

305
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,319
- What happened?
- Slashed.

306
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:49,319
That dick from earlier?

307
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,861
What now? Do you remember his face?

308
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:53,236
No.

309
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:55,070
Come with me.

310
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:56,986
Hey, Taki!

311
00:24:57,986 --> 00:24:59,653
Take off your skirt.

312
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:02,112
Oh! I'll look the other way!

313
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:08,278
This won't take long.

314
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:13,737
Done!

315
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:18,488
Wow, Taki! It looks better than before!

316
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:23,780
Thank you for saving me today.

317
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:28,988
Actually, I was concerned about you.

318
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,239
You're weak but quick-tempered.

319
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:34,989
I like you better today.

320
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:39,323
Never knew you had a feminine side.

321
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:42,490
"JR Yamanote Line: 8 min."

322
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:53,574
What a realistic dream
if I say so myself.

323
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,991
Oh, he keeps a diary.

324
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,492
He's so organized.

325
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:09,242
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

326
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:13,992
Oh! That's her!

327
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,368
A crush, maybe?

328
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,993
"Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

329
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:35,827
"Who are you?"

330
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,328
"Mitsuha"

331
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:06,329
What is this?

332
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:07,830
"Mitsuha"

333
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:13,330
Wha...? Wha...?

334
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:15,372
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"
What's going on?

335
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:16,163
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

336
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:18,247
Let's go to a café again.

337
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:20,664
Sorry, I have to go to work.

338
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,664
Do you remember where to go?

339
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:28,581
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

340
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,164
Oh, never mind. See you.

341
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:35,957
He's acting normal today.

342
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:38,790
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

343
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:39,665
What?

344
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,499
Wha... What?

345
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,874
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

346
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,666
You walked home with her!

347
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:53,958
Did I really? With Ms. Okudera?

348
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,666
What happened afterwards?

349
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,166
I don't really remember.

350
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,750
Oh really, now?

351
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,333
Coming through.

352
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,167
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

353
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,417
Let's make this a good one.

354
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:11,668
Right, Taki?

355
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:24,752
"Mitsuha? Who are you?
What are you?"

356
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:28,252
You're not touching your boobs today.

357
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,752
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

358
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:35,545
Boobs?

359
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,753
Morning.

360
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,837
Why is everyone staring at me?

361
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:51,337
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

362
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,003
Huh?

363
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:55,304
"Still life drawing"

364
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:56,504
Did you see the election posters?

365
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,921
Doesn't matter who wins.
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

366
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:03,171
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

367
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:06,505
They mean me, right?

368
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:08,296
Well, yeah.

369
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,672
Hey, Mitsuha!

370
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,339
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

371
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:29,048
Mitsuha?

372
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:38,799
Is this... Could this be...

373
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,715
Could this be that we're really...

374
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,216
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

375
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:49,133
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

376
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:51,800
switching places?

377
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:29,386
<i>I'm beginning to get what's going on.</i>

378
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,636
<i>Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.</i>

379
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,845
<i>I switch with Mitsuha at random,</i>

380
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,886
<i>a few times a week unexpectedly.</i>

381
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,846
<i>Sleep triggers it.
The cause is a mystery.</i>

382
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:42,220
"Condition: Sleep?
Cause: Unknown"

383
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:47,054
<i>My memory of the switch is hazy
after I wake up.</i>

384
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,555
<i>But we're definitely switching places.</i>

385
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:54,555
<i>It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So...</i>

386
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,388
<i>So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.</i>

387
00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:02,230
"No baths! No looking!
No touching!"

388
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,556
<i>Things to watch out during the switch
and a list of "don'ts."</i>

389
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:05,606
"Don't waste money! No dialect!
Don't be late!"

390
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:08,597
<i>We also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.</i>

391
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:13,722
<i>To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.</i>

392
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:15,681
<i>But...</i>

393
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:17,223
<i>But...</i>

394
00:31:17,764 --> 00:31:19,973
- That girl!
- That guy!

395
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,142
<i>Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!</i>

396
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:44,142
<i>Stop wasting my money!</i>

397
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:47,058
<i>It's YOUR body eating.
And I'm working too!</i>

398
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:48,275
"Braided cords..."

399
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:49,225
<i>Braided cords... I can't do this!</i>

400
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,183
<i>You work too many shifts!</i>

401
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,851
<i>It's 'cause you waste money!</i>

402
00:32:13,227 --> 00:32:17,519
<i>Grabbed' coffee with Ms. Okudera.
You two have a good thing going!</i>

403
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,061
<i>Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!</i>

404
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,561
<i>Taki, why is a girl in love with me?</i>

405
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:27,603
<i>You're more popular when I'm you.</i>

406
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:30,562
<i>Don't be full of yourself!
Not like YOU have a girlfriend!</i>

407
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:31,854
<i>You don't have a boyfriend!</i>

408
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,728
"Fool/Idiot" <i>- I...
- I...</i>

409
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:35,770
I'm single because I want to be!

410
00:32:57,772 --> 00:32:59,480
I shouldn't for her sake.

411
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,814
You sure do like your boobs.

412
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,314
We're going now! Get ready!

413
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:15,523
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

414
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:17,315
<i>When and where can it be seen?</i>

415
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,115
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

416
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:23,858
<i>Comet Tiamat is moving from east to west
as if to follow the sun.</i>

417
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:25,858
<i>So it can be seen above Venus...</i>

418
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:27,816
Why the uniform?

419
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:40,775
Grandma, why is the body
of our shrine's god so far away?

420
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:44,401
I don't know because of Mayugoro.

421
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:45,859
Who's that?

422
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,317
What? He's famous!

423
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,860
Here, Grandma.

424
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,819
Whoa, Mitsuha.

425
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:19,820
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know "Musubi"?

426
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:21,361
Musubi?

427
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:26,611
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

428
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:29,820
This word has profound meaning.

429
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:35,779
Tying thread is Musubi.
Connecting people is Musubi.

430
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:38,321
The flow of time is Musubi.

431
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:41,697
These are all the god's power.

432
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:45,446
So the braided cords that we make

433
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:50,989
are the god's art and represent
the flow of time itself.

434
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:54,322
They converge and take shape.

435
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,573
They twist, tangle

436
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,197
sometimes unravel, break,
then connect again.

437
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:05,823
<i>Musubi</i> - knotting. That's time.

438
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:10,365
Drink.

439
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:11,824
Thank you.

440
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:13,949
I want some too!

441
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:16,323
That's also Musubi.

442
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,366
Whether it be water, rice, or <i>sake,</i>

443
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:25,825
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

444
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,491
So today's offering

445
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:34,325
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

446
00:35:36,075 --> 00:35:37,867
Hey, I see it!

447
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:45,201
That's the body
of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

448
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,578
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

449
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,536
It means the underworld.

450
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,036
It's the underworld!

451
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:18,829
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

452
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:21,203
what is most important to you.

453
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,079
The kuchikamisake.

454
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:27,579
The kuchikamisake?

455
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,580
You'll offer it inside the god's body.

456
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:35,371
It's half of you.

457
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:39,289
<i>Half of Mitsuha...</i>

458
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,248
It's twilight - "kataware-doki" already.

459
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:01,331
Kataware-doki?

460
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:12,749
Oh yeah,

461
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,708
maybe I can see the comet.

462
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,708
The comet?

463
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:19,333
Oh,

464
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:21,333
Mitsuha,

465
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,833
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

466
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:38,710
Tears? Why?

467
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:43,334
"I'm almost there.
Looking forward to it!"

468
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:47,335
Ms. Okudera? What's she talking about?

469
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,544
What did Mitsuha do this time?

470
00:37:52,294 --> 00:37:53,335
A date?

471
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,878
<i>A date with Ms. Okudera tomorrow!</i>

472
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:06,336
<i>Meet at 10:30 a.m. at the station!</i>

473
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:11,336
...was what I'd planned, but...

474
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:26,338
Taki.

475
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:29,422
Sorry. Did you wait long?

476
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:31,088
Yes. No...

477
00:38:31,463 --> 00:38:33,297
Um...

478
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:43,047
I just got here.

479
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:45,339
Good. Let's go.

480
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:50,923
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

481
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:55,798
Hey?

482
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,340
I...

483
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,549
Why?

484
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,341
<i>I wanted to go on this date,</i>

485
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:17,842
<i>but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!</i>

486
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:26,842
<i>However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before,</i>

487
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,885
I don't know what to say...

488
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,302
<i>so below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.</i>

489
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:36,718
Really?

490
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:38,093
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

491
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:43,594
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting."

492
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,094
She's making fun of me.

493
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:50,094
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

494
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:16,096
Taki...

495
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,555
You're like a different person today.

496
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:35,097
Um, Ms. Okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner...

497
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:38,556
Let's call it a day.

498
00:40:40,347 --> 00:40:41,389
Yes.

499
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:45,056
Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.

500
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:50,098
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

501
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:54,599
But now you like someone else.

502
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,224
No I don't!

503
00:40:58,349 --> 00:40:59,141
Really?

504
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,600
No! That's not true at all.

505
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:03,683
I wonder.

506
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:08,474
Oh well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

507
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:28,351
<i>By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.</i>

508
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,060
What is she saying?

509
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,852
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

510
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,854
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

511
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:11,396
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

512
00:42:12,104 --> 00:42:15,771
What? The festival? Well...

513
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:21,813
Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

514
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,355
Okay, got it. Later, then.

515
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,731
You just want to see her in a <i>yukata</i>.

516
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:32,814
What I? No!

517
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,939
That didn't even occur to me.

518
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,064
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

519
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,191
Maybe you annoyed her.

520
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:42,398
Come on!

521
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:43,440
Sorry I'm late.

522
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:44,982
- Here she is!
- Finally!

523
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:50,399
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

524
00:42:51,316 --> 00:42:52,691
Your hair!

525
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:56,524
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

526
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:08,567
You think some guy is the reason?
Ditched, maybe?

527
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:11,525
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

528
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,026
She said she just felt like it.

529
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,568
Really? She just felt like cutting off
that much hair?

530
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:20,526
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

531
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,111
Wow!

532
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:04,654
<i>The number you are trying to call is not
reachable or has been turned off...</i>

533
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:12,906
<i>I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,</i>

534
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,780
<i>I thought. But...</i>

535
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,655
<i>For some reason, after that,</i>

536
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:23,531
<i>Mitsuha and I never
switched places again.</i>

537
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:01,534
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

538
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,951
"Hida mountains"

539
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:20,998
What the... What are you doing here?

540
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:26,373
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

541
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:35,499
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me
at home and at work.

542
00:46:35,624 --> 00:46:36,874
Takagi will cover your shift.

543
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:40,124
<i>Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!</i>

544
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,249
This isn't funny.

545
00:46:42,415 --> 00:46:44,666
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

546
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,917
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

547
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,167
A con act?

548
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:51,459
You're meeting an online friend.

549
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:53,918
Well no, not exactly...

550
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,250
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

551
00:46:57,126 --> 00:47:00,834
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

552
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,626
I'm not a kid!

553
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:09,460
<i>The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.</i>

554
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:14,127
<i>So I decided to go see Mitsuha
in person.</i>

555
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:17,377
<i>I wanted to meet her. But...</i>

556
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,920
What? You don't know where?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

557
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:25,878
Yes.

558
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:32,253
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

559
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:35,086
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

560
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:36,420
I did not plan a tour!

561
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:39,879
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

562
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:43,046
Oh how cute! Look!

563
00:47:43,254 --> 00:47:44,213
So annoying.

564
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:46,379
Oh, it moved!

565
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,506
So it's impossible after all...

566
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:20,381
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

567
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:25,549
You haven't done anything.

568
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:30,341
A Takayama ramen.

569
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:31,883
A Takayama ramen.

570
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:33,716
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

571
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:36,925
- Okay. 3 ramens.
- Okay.

572
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,467
Can we return to Tokyo today?

573
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:44,759
We could be cutting it close.
I'll check.

574
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:45,634
Thanks.

575
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,092
Are you all right with that?

576
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:54,967
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

577
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,718
Why young man,
that's Itomori, isn't it?

578
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:07,260
It's a very good drawing.
Isn't it, dear?

579
00:49:08,928 --> 00:49:12,427
Yeah, it's Itomori.
Brings back memories.

580
00:49:12,594 --> 00:49:14,761
He was born in Itomori.

581
00:49:14,928 --> 00:49:16,345
Itomori...?

582
00:49:18,094 --> 00:49:22,845
Yes! Itomori Town! That's it!
It's nearby, isn't it?

583
00:49:23,136 --> 00:49:25,762
- What are you...
- Itomori was...

584
00:49:26,094 --> 00:49:28,762
Itomori? No way!

585
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:31,554
Is it where that comet...?

586
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:42,512
"Keep Out"

587
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:24,099
Hey. Is this really the place?

588
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:28,099
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

589
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:31,892
No. I'm sure this is it.

590
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:37,600
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

591
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,517
That can't be true!

592
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:44,893
Surely you remember that disaster
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

593
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,018
Died?

594
00:50:48,185 --> 00:50:51,518
Died 3 years ago?

595
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:54,769
That can't be.

596
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:59,352
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

597
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,354
They're disappearing...

598
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:30,896
Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

599
00:51:31,096 --> 00:51:33,530
"Itomori,
the Town that Vanished"

600
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:34,771
made a close approach to Earth
3 years ago in October.

601
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:38,855
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town" Nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

602
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:42,105
"Town Annihilated"

603
00:51:42,437 --> 00:51:43,855
"Over 500 dead or missing"

604
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,356
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

605
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:50,356
A fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck Japan.

606
00:51:50,689 --> 00:51:53,156
"Itomori, comet, damage"

607
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:56,606
It was the day of the autumn festival.

608
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:58,981
The point of impact was here.

609
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:05,357
At 8:42 p.m., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

610
00:52:07,482 --> 00:52:10,657
"List of the Names of Victims"

611
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:12,857
Over 500 people died,
a third of the town's population,

612
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:16,608
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

613
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:28,359
Tessie and Sayaka...

614
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:34,359
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

615
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:39,692
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died 3 years ago!

616
00:52:39,817 --> 00:52:45,985
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible.

617
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,109
So...

618
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:48,902
<i>You 're dreaming now...</i>

619
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:50,360
I...

620
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:52,361
<i>...aren't you?</i>

621
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,444
I...

622
00:52:56,444 --> 00:52:57,778
What did I...?

623
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:13,779
Lively up there.

624
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:16,487
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

625
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:17,862
No problem.

626
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,071
How's Taki?

627
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,488
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

628
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:26,863
Newspapers and magazines
at the time at random it seems.

629
00:53:31,988 --> 00:53:35,280
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

630
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:39,072
Oh. I'd quit recently, but...

631
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,280
What do you think about Taki's story?

632
00:53:46,113 --> 00:53:47,948
I liked him.

633
00:53:48,864 --> 00:53:54,406
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

634
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,740
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

635
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:03,865
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

636
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,783
But I'm sure he met someone
and that someone changed him.

637
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:16,250
That much is for sure, I think.

638
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:16,741
"Worst-ever
Itomori Comet Disaster"

639
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:31,867
It was all just a dream.

640
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:39,534
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

641
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:43,619
If not that, then... a ghost?

642
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:48,869
No... Was I fantasizing?

643
00:54:52,744 --> 00:54:56,203
Her name... What was it?

644
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,370
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

645
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:05,370
Oh, Ms.Okudera. I, uh...

646
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:11,371
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

647
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,871
No problem.

648
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:18,579
"Tatara Iron Making Site"

649
00:55:18,704 --> 00:55:20,687
"Braided Cords of Itomori"

650
00:55:20,887 --> 00:55:22,871
Braided cords. How pretty.

651
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:26,789
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

652
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:32,872
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

653
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:37,164
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

654
00:55:39,748 --> 00:55:40,873
Who was it?

655
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:46,123
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

656
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,165
Yes...No.

657
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,624
Someone who makes braided cords
told me before...

658
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,832
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

659
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:04,958
The threads twist, tangle,
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

660
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,166
Maybe at that place...

661
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,001
"Around here?"

662
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:35,877

<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

666
00:56:57,795 --> 00:57:02,629
"I have to go somewhere. Return to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

667
00:57:06,046 --> 00:57:07,380
Taki...

668
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:33,131
Eat this up there.

669
00:57:34,547 --> 00:57:38,131
Your drawing of Itomori... It was good.

<i>They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,</i>

671
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:24,134
<i>sometimes unravel,
then connect again...</i>

672
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,635
<i>Musubi - knotting. That's time.</i>

673
00:58:40,136 --> 00:58:41,386
There it is!

674
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,053
It's really there!

675
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:49,053
It wasn't just a dream!

676
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,555
From here is the underworld.

677
00:59:45,808 --> 00:59:48,516
It's the <i>sake</i> we brought.

678
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:53,141
This is my sister's, and this is mine.

679
00:59:56,058 --> 01:00:02,558
Before the comet struck... So the
Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

680
01:00:04,725 --> 01:00:07,559
Our timelines weren't in step.

681
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:11,768
Half of her...

682
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:27,477
Musubi.

683
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:31,686
If time can really be turned back,

684
01:00:32,978 --> 01:00:34,936
give me one last chance...

685
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,354
The comet!

686
01:01:55,693 --> 01:01:58,651
Your name is Mitsuha.

687
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,277
You're both my treasures.

688
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,818
You're a big sister now.

689
01:02:09,985 --> 01:02:12,402
"Get well soon, Mom."

690
01:02:12,694 --> 01:02:15,069
I'm so sorry, my dears.

691
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:20,194
Dad, when is Mom going to come home?

692
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:22,528
I couldn't save her.

693
01:02:22,653 --> 01:02:24,569
Get a hold of yourself!

694
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:25,945
Who cares about the shrine?

695
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:27,736
You're the adopted son-in-law!

696
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,945
I loved my wife Futaba.
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

697
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:32,528
Get out of here!

698
01:02:34,903 --> 01:02:37,487
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

699
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:41,153
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

700
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:46,862
"Who are you?"
Who am I? No, who are you?

701
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:48,154
Who am I? No, who are you?

702
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,038
"Fool"

703
01:02:49,238 --> 01:02:51,738
Don't be full of yourself.
Not like YOU have a girlfriend.

704
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:55,488
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

705
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:57,947
I...

706
01:02:58,072 --> 01:02:59,322
I'm going to Tokyo.

707
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:00,531
What? Hey, Mitsuha!

708
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:07,155
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

709
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:10,614
Oh yeah, the comet.

710
01:03:11,406 --> 01:03:14,323
Today's the peak of its brightness...

711
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:16,448
<i>Mitsuha! Don't stay there!</i>

712
01:03:17,614 --> 01:03:21,991
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!</i>

713
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:26,490
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there!</i>

714
01:03:27,324 --> 01:03:29,616
<i>Mitsuha! Mitsuha!</i>

715
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:31,825
<i>Mitsuha!</i>

716
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,118
I'm Mitsuha! She's still alive!

717
01:04:04,077 --> 01:04:05,868
Mitsuha, are you touching...

718
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:10,536
My sister!

719
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,786
Yotsuha!

720
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:20,203
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

721
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:22,869
I'm leaving without her.

722
01:04:23,495 --> 01:04:25,453
She's lost it.

723
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:28,120
She's completely lost it.

724
01:04:28,245 --> 01:04:29,578
Scary.

725
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:34,079
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

726
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:38,037
<i>Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,</i>

727
01:04:38,162 --> 01:04:40,788
<i>and will achieve its maximum brightness.</i>

728
01:04:40,913 --> 01:04:43,788
It's tonight. There's still time.

729
01:04:44,496 --> 01:04:46,163
Good morning, Mitsuha.

730
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:47,997
Oh...

731
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,706
You're not Mitsuha, are you?

732
01:04:52,664 --> 01:04:55,998
You knew, Grandma?

733
01:04:56,455 --> 01:05:02,540
No, but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories.

734
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:09,040
I also remember seeing strange dreams
when I was a young girl.

735
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:16,082
Although now I've forgotten about
whose life I was dreaming about.

736
01:05:16,832 --> 01:05:17,957
Forgotten...

737
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:23,041
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

738
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:28,041
There were times your mother and I
had similar experiences.

739
01:05:29,082 --> 01:05:32,750
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had

740
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:36,500
were all for what will happen today.

741
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:39,042
Grandma, listen.

742
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,418
A comet will strike Itomori tonight
and everyone will die.

743
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:57,002
<i>"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, Grandma.</i>

744
01:05:57,502 --> 01:05:59,835
I won't let them die!

745
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,502
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

746
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:07,919
Your... your hair!

747
01:06:08,044 --> 01:06:10,586
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

748
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,169
Oh, that's it?

749
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:16,461
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

750
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,878
So we have to act!

751
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:27,379
Why aren't you at school?

752
01:06:27,504 --> 01:06:32,213
Uh... We have to save the town.

753
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:35,005
The community wireless system?

754
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,629
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

755
01:06:39,337 --> 01:06:41,130
"Superimposition, frequency"

756
01:06:42,338 --> 01:06:46,172
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

757
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:48,797
Hey! Don't come so close!

758
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,006
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

759
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:54,172
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

760
01:06:54,756 --> 01:06:57,131
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

761
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,798
You're such a nice guy!

762
01:07:02,505 --> 01:07:04,673
Got them. Here's your change.

763
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:06,090
Sorry, Sayaka.

764
01:07:06,215 --> 01:07:07,590
It's all right.

765
01:07:07,716 --> 01:07:10,132
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

766
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:16,091
What about you? Have you come up
with an escape plan?

767
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:21,800
What? A bomb?

768
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:26,466
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

769
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:27,967
Broadcast hijacking?

770
01:07:28,633 --> 01:07:33,301
The town's wireless system can be easily
jacked using the startup frequency.

771
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:36,884
So we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school.

772
01:07:37,676 --> 01:07:42,176
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

773
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:45,468
It's... It's totally a crime!

774
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,135
You do the broadcast.

775
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,844
- Why?
- You're in the broadcast club.

776
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,635
I'm in charge of explosives.

777
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,844
I'll go talk to the mayor.

778
01:07:54,385 --> 01:07:58,219
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

779
01:07:58,344 --> 01:08:01,344
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

780
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,636
It's a perfect plan.

781
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,387
Oh, whatever. It's just a
what-if fantasy, isn't it?

782
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:11,845
What? Well...

783
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:15,887
Not necessarily! Do you know
how Lake Itomori was formed?

784
01:08:16,012 --> 01:08:19,687
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

785
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,971
It's a meteor crater! So one did strike
this area a thousand years ago!

786
01:08:22,096 --> 01:08:23,637
Oh! So that's why...

787
01:08:24,138 --> 01:08:26,013
You're right, Tessie!

788
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,638
Let's do it together!

789
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:38,139
What on earth are you talking about?

790
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,848
I said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

791
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:45,139
Shut your mouth.

792
01:08:51,055 --> 01:08:54,140
"The comet will split and
strike the town"?

793
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:57,140
"Itomori Town Hall"

794
01:08:57,682 --> 01:09:00,141
How dare you spout such nonsense?

795
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,724
If you're serious, then you're sick.

796
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,141
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

797
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:12,766
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

798
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:16,975
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

799
01:09:20,558 --> 01:09:21,726
You son of a...!

800
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:34,059
Mitsuha! No...

801
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:36,184
Who...

802
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:39,310
Who are you?

803
01:09:53,519 --> 01:09:55,519
See you later at the festival.

804
01:09:55,685 --> 01:09:57,395
Let's meet at the shrine.

805
01:09:57,519 --> 01:09:58,561
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

806
01:09:58,686 --> 01:10:00,228
- See you.
- Later.

807
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:03,228
You shouldn't go!

808
01:10:03,812 --> 01:10:06,228
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

809
01:10:06,353 --> 01:10:07,603
What are you saying?

810
01:10:07,729 --> 01:10:08,729
Mitsuha!

811
01:10:08,853 --> 01:10:11,187
- What was that?
- Let's go.

812
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,687
What are you doing?

813
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:15,979
Could Mitsuha...

814
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:19,730
Could she have persuaded them?
Is it my fault?

815
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:23,980
Yotsuha, leave town with Grandma
before nightfall.

816
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:26,022
You'll die if you stay here!

817
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:28,063
What are you saying?

818
01:10:28,188 --> 01:10:32,605
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

819
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,689
Tokyo?

820
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:38,647
Hey, Mitsuha!

821
01:10:40,856 --> 01:10:42,981
How did it go with your old man?

822
01:10:45,106 --> 01:10:46,773
Hey, Mitsuha?

823
01:10:47,397 --> 01:10:48,606
What's wrong with her?

824
01:10:48,732 --> 01:10:49,857
No idea.

825
01:11:00,025 --> 01:11:01,566
Are you there?

826
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:04,983
Is something over there?

827
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,649
Let me use your bike.

828
01:11:06,774 --> 01:11:07,774
Hey, what the...

829
01:11:07,898 --> 01:11:09,108
Hey, Mitsuha!

830
01:11:10,358 --> 01:11:11,692
What about our plan?

831
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:13,692
Get ready as planned!

832
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,734
Please!

833
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:44,194
I'm Taki again.

834
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:50,528
What's Taki doing here?

835
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:00,321
The town...

836
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:02,654
is gone.

837
01:12:12,363 --> 01:12:15,863
At that moment... did I...

838
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:20,822
die?

839
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,197
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

840
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:37,698
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

841
01:12:50,323 --> 01:12:52,283
I'm going to Tokyo.

842
01:12:52,407 --> 01:12:53,699
What? Now?

843
01:12:54,116 --> 01:12:55,199
Why?

844
01:12:55,698 --> 01:12:56,700
A date.

845
01:12:56,866 --> 01:12:59,033
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

846
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:01,074
Not my date.

847
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,366
I'll come home tonight.

848
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:12,200
<i>If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?</i>

849
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,909
<i>He might not like it.</i>

850
01:13:23,076 --> 01:13:26,744
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

851
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,827
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

852
01:13:28,952 --> 01:13:31,202
<i>But what if we did?</i>

853
01:13:31,827 --> 01:13:36,202
<i>What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?</i>

854
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:39,202
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

855
01:13:40,077 --> 01:13:43,120
<i>he'd be a bit glad to see me?</i>

856
01:13:44,037 --> 01:13:48,203
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

857
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:51,120
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

858
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:53,787
<i>But...</i>

859
01:13:55,203 --> 01:13:57,704
<i>...one thing is certain.</i>

860
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:02,538
<i>If we see each other, we'll know.</i>

861
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:06,621
<i>That you were the one who was inside me.</i>

862
01:14:07,538 --> 01:14:10,538
<i>That I was the one who was inside you.</i>

863
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:12,371
I'm sorry.

864
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,707
Excuse me.

865
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:21,210
<i>That time 3 years ago,
before I got to know you...</i>

866
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:26,210
Taki.

867
01:15:27,544 --> 01:15:28,711
Taki.

868
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:31,794
Taki.

869
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,961
Um... It's me.

870
01:15:37,419 --> 01:15:39,545
Don't you remember me?

871
01:15:41,045 --> 01:15:42,211
Who are you?

872
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:48,379
I'm sorry.

873
01:15:56,379 --> 01:15:57,713
<i>But he's Taki.</i>

874
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:00,713
<i>Weird girl.</i>

875
01:16:09,629 --> 01:16:10,589
Hey!

876
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,089
What's your name?

877
01:16:13,839 --> 01:16:14,756
Mitsuha!

878
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,714
My name is Mitsuha!

879
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:29,965
<i>That time 3 years ago, you came...</i>

880
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:32,174
<i>to see me!</i>

881
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,383
Taki?

882
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,800
Mitsuha!

883
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,343
Taki?

884
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,510
Mitsuha!

885
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:17,510
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

886
01:17:18,053 --> 01:17:19,677
Taki!

887
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:22,178
Taki, where are you?

888
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:24,219
It's Mitsuha.

889
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:26,470
I can hear her, but...

890
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:30,553
Taki, where are you?

891
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:31,636
Taki!

892
01:17:45,013 --> 01:17:47,055
Taki, are you...

893
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:49,846
there?

894
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:16,514
It's twilight - "kataware-doki."

895
01:18:31,557 --> 01:18:32,516
Mitsuha.

896
01:18:39,017 --> 01:18:40,183
Taki.

897
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,975
Taki. It's really you.

898
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,225
Taki!

899
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,517
I came to see you.

900
01:18:52,893 --> 01:18:56,851
It wasn't easy because
you were so far away.

901
01:18:56,976 --> 01:19:01,727
But how? At that moment, I...

902
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:04,268
I drank your kuchikamisake.

903
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:10,227
You drank that?

904
01:19:11,643 --> 01:19:12,727
You idiot! Pervert!

905
01:19:13,852 --> 01:19:16,811
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

906
01:19:16,935 --> 01:19:18,895
How do you know that?

907
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,644
Yotsuha saw it.

908
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:24,478
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

909
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:26,020
Just once?

910
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:29,978
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

911
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:32,020
Sorry.

912
01:19:32,228 --> 01:19:34,520
Oh, this...

913
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:39,021
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me
before I knew you?

914
01:19:39,395 --> 01:19:41,355
There's no way I'd recognize you.

915
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,897
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

916
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,480
Now you keep it.

917
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,521
Yes.

918
01:19:58,397 --> 01:19:59,731
How is it?

919
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,023
Not bad.

920
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:03,564
You're lying!

921
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:06,023
No, I... Sorry.

922
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:08,565
You're really so...!

923
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:25,024
Mitsuha, you still have
things to do. Listen.

924
01:20:28,232 --> 01:20:29,108
It's coming.

925
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:32,150
Don't worry. You've still got time.

926
01:20:32,275 --> 01:20:34,108
Yes, I'll try.

927
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,567
Kataware-doki is almost...

928
01:20:38,983 --> 01:20:40,192
over.

929
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:46,068
Hey, Mitsuha. So we don't forget
when we wake up...

930
01:20:50,777 --> 01:20:54,193
Let's write our names
on each other. Here.

931
01:20:55,943 --> 01:20:56,735
Okay!

932
01:21:06,402 --> 01:21:07,402
Mitsuha?

933
01:21:09,903 --> 01:21:11,527
Hey, Mitsuha?

934
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:22,320
I wanted to tell you.

935
01:21:24,196 --> 01:21:29,112
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll search for you.

936
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:35,030
Your name is Mitsuha.

937
01:21:36,738 --> 01:21:38,780
It's okay. I remember.

938
01:21:39,197 --> 01:21:43,072
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.
Your name is Mitsuha.

939
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:44,697
Your name is...

940
01:21:55,073 --> 01:21:58,073
Who are you?

941
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:03,157
Why did I come here?

942
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,199
I came here to see her.

943
01:22:07,615 --> 01:22:11,032
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

944
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:15,449
Who was it? Who?
Who did I come to see?

945
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:20,824
Someone dear to me. I don't want
to forget. I shouldn't forget!

946
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,949
Who? Who? Who? Who?

947
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,034
What's your name?

948
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:47,077
<i>Taki. Taki. Taki.</i>

949
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:50,910
<i>It's okay. I remember. I'll never forget!</i>

950
01:22:51,619 --> 01:22:53,702
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

951
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:57,036
<i>Your name is Taki!</i>

Tessie!

954
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,745
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

955
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:17,745
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

956
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,371
- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

957
01:23:22,078 --> 01:23:24,704
Explain everything to me later.

958
01:23:28,746 --> 01:23:31,372
That's going to fall? Really?

959
01:23:31,497 --> 01:23:33,538
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

960
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:36,330
What? You saw it, huh?

961
01:23:36,455 --> 01:23:41,538
Then I guess we got no choice.
Now we're both criminals!

"Broadcasting Room"

963
01:23:44,538 --> 01:23:46,247
What? I really have to do it?

964
01:23:46,414 --> 01:23:52,748
When the town's power goes out, the
equipment there should work on backup.

965
01:23:53,082 --> 01:23:56,165
Please, Sayaka!
Repeat it as much as you can!

966
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,831
Woo-hoo! You can do it!

967
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:02,374
Oh, to heck with it!

968
01:24:08,665 --> 01:24:11,541
- Soon, you think?
- I've no idea!

969
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:23,459
- What was that?
- What's that sound?

970
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,917
Hey, look!

971
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,503
Hey, look!

972
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,545
<i>This is Itomori Town Hall.</i>

973
01:25:06,002 --> 01:25:09,754
<i>An explosion has occurred
at the substation.</i>

Who is it, then?

01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,130
<i>Miyamori District...</i>

Tessie!

982
01:25:46,382 --> 01:25:48,632
Run, everyone! Forest fire!

983
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:51,090
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

984
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:52,924
Run! Fire!

985
01:25:53,049 --> 01:25:56,049
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

986
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,549
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

987
01:26:01,716 --> 01:26:02,883
What's wrong?

988
01:26:03,716 --> 01:26:07,383
His name... I can't remember his name.

989
01:26:10,342 --> 01:26:13,425
Look, I don't know.
You started all this!

990
01:26:14,509 --> 01:26:17,258
We can't evacuate everyone by ourselves!

991
01:26:17,592 --> 01:26:19,967
Go persuade your father!

992
01:26:28,259 --> 01:26:31,510
Everyone run! Go to the high school!

993
01:26:34,094 --> 01:26:35,385
Oh, Mitsuha.

994
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:42,135
It's no terrorist attack!
What's Chubu Electric saying?

995
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,761
They're still checking!

996
01:26:43,928 --> 01:26:47,260
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

997
01:26:47,386 --> 01:26:48,386
Okay!

998
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:53,595
Stop this broadcast!
Figure out where it's coming from!

999
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:56,387
The Takayama sensor station called!

1000
01:26:57,428 --> 01:26:58,887

Oh no.

1005
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:18,763
What have you done, Sayaka!

1006
01:27:22,096 --> 01:27:24,847
<i>This is Itomori Town Hall.</i>

<i>Please don't panic and stay
where you are for further notice.</i>

1009
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:36,473
Stay put, they said.

1010
01:27:37,264 --> 01:27:39,431
- What's going on?
- So we stay put?

1011
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:45,556
Come on, you should all evacuate!
The high school is the shelter!

1012
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,057
Katsuhiko!

1013
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,016
What are you doing?

1014
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,225
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1015
01:27:58,599 --> 01:27:59,933
It's over.

1016
01:28:02,266 --> 01:28:05,934
It's really splitting apart!

1017
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:14,101
- Look at that!
- Wow!

1018
01:28:14,267 --> 01:28:16,934
<i>Please look! The comet has split in two</i>

1019
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:18,851
<i>and meteors are falling!</i>

1020
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:21,684
<i>Nobody predicted this.</i>

1021
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:23,434
<i>We have a mystical view here.</i>

1022
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,518
<i>So the comet's nucleus split?</i>

1023
01:28:25,643 --> 01:28:26,935
<i>Did tidal forces affect...</i>

1024
01:28:27,102 --> 01:28:31,936
<i>The comet isn't within the Roche limit
so the nucleus itself must have...</i>

1025
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:37,311
<i>In the past, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.</i>

1026
01:28:37,435 --> 01:28:38,685
<i>At least twenty-one fragments...</i>

1027
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:40,936
I'm going to go look!

1028
01:28:41,603 --> 01:28:44,937
<i>They will probably melt
before reaching the ground</i>

1029
01:28:45,269 --> 01:28:49,436
<i>and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small...</i>

1030
01:28:49,603 --> 01:28:51,187
<i>To predict the trajectory...</i>

1031
01:28:51,312 --> 01:28:54,646
<i>To be witnessing such a magnificent
celestial event, and...</i>

1032
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:57,521
<i>That we're witnessing this live</i>

1033
01:28:57,646 --> 01:29:02,229
<i>is extremely fortunate
for those of us living in this age.</i>

1034
01:29:04,646 --> 01:29:07,522
<i>Hey. Who are you?</i>

1035
01:29:11,855 --> 01:29:13,522
<i>Who? Who?</i>

1036
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:15,939
<i>Who is that?</i>

1037
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:20,688
<i>Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.
I didn't want to forget!</i>

1038
01:29:22,355 --> 01:29:25,856
<i>Who? Who? Who are you?</i>

1039
01:29:27,272 --> 01:29:28,940
<i>What's your name?</i>

1040
01:29:35,772 --> 01:29:37,023
It's broken!

1041
01:29:56,608 --> 01:30:01,484
<i>So we don't forget when we wake up,
let's write our names on each other.</i>

1042
01:30:11,026 --> 01:30:13,443
"I love you"

1043
01:30:28,652 --> 01:30:32,985
I can't remember your name with this...

1044
01:30:46,445 --> 01:30:47,862
Dad!

1045
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:51,154
- Mitsuha!
- Mitsuha!

1046
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,695
Not you again...

1047
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:01,363
<i>It was almost as if it were
a scene from a dream.</i>

1048
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:05,738
<i>Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.</i>

1049
01:32:36,995 --> 01:32:42,954
What am I doing here?

1050
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:18,289
<i>I'm always searching for something.</i>

1051
01:33:19,124 --> 01:33:22,915
<i>This feeling has possessed me
for some time.</i>

1052
01:33:25,082 --> 01:33:26,873
I applied because...

1053
01:33:26,998 --> 01:33:28,374
The landscapes people live in...

1054
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:30,374
To build a city's landscape...

1055
01:33:30,665 --> 01:33:34,666
You never know when Tokyo
might disappear as well.

1056
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:40,874
So I want to help build landscapes that
leave heartwarming memories...

1057
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,167
How many interviews have you had?

1058
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:46,375
I haven't kept track.

1059
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,834
- Can't see you landing a job.
- Thanks a lot!

1060
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:50,376
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1061
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:52,376
We're not that different!
